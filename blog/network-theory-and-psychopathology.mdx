## Network Theory and Psychopathology

The still reigning dominance of classifying psychological pathologies through the 
use of the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual), which implicitly 
implies the existence of underlying latent factors, becomes increasingly problematic.

This becomes clear already when observing the gradual changes in the DSM disorders
over the course of the different DSM versions. There appears to be a movement that
slowly converts the strict boundaries of disorders into clusters of spectrums.
The autism disorder is an obvious exemplar of this. In the DSM-III this disorder
was first included with a particular set of related symptoms. In the DSM-IV
this was expanded to include several subtypes leading to more heterogeneous diagnoses. 
Then, in the DSM-5, everything was collapsed again into a single diagnosis again that goes by 
the name of Autism Spectrum Disorder. This spectrum tries to 'fit' the broad range of symptoms
onto the implicit notion that there must be something underneath that is called autism.
Yet, what it looks like to me, is that the experts project their notion of what
this pathological entity entails, back onto the symptoms.

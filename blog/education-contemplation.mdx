## Education Contemplation

As of recent, I joined a small circle of like-minded people to actively think and discuss the current state of the
education system. All of the people involved are in contact with universities and have had experiences with various
subjects, faculties and are interested with the topic of learning.

The goal of these bi-weekly meetings is to gain greater clarity on the subjects we explore and benefit from the
motivating dynamics of a group driven by curiosity and a quest for deeper understanding. We are starting from a set of
very general philosophical standpoints but are slowly moving towards more concrete actions.

I am sharing some of my personal thoughts and insights from these sessions here.

### Question hierarchy

Each session starts of with one or two questions that we would like to explore. The purpose of this is to guide and
structure our exploration but in a way that is minimal and still allows for different perspectives. Over time, this will
develop in a hierarchy of questions, so that we can keep track and follow our direction of inquiry over the course of
the sessions.

This hierarchy below represents our progress thus far:

          The broader objectives that the educational system, either implicitly or explicitly, is set out to accomplish:
          to contribute to the advancement of science and technology, to train productive members of society, to form
          individuals who can lead a good life, and to increase collective happiness.

#### Open questions

- What would a ritual look like that continually exposes and explicates identity? (who am I?, why am I doing this?)
- How to achieve the unity of thought on the level of purpose and value system?
- How to create communities which are engaged with active process of learning?
- How can school instill the love of learning?
- How do we embed schools in communities and families? 
- How can education build students’ self-confidence?
- How can we help others see the underlying assumptions of any educational system more clearly?

  - Increase collective happiness
- How to develop a continuous integrative process within education?

universities must transform from institutions of knowledge transfer to living ecosystems of innovation that regenerate
soil, society, and self.

I like:
`Higher ed must stop overvaluing knowledge, comfort, and action, and start valuing not-knowing, discomfort, and stillness the foundations of creativity and real change.`

- This highlights the learning as you go, even in the providers of education. (experimental, trying things out)

`“breathing” cycle of immersion and reflection.`

`Learning to become co-creators`

- They currently look at the implemention level (in terms of reflection)
- NOt on a purpose level

## How to achieve unity of thought on the level of purpose and value system?

It should reflect the vision values

- Show humility as a organization. We setup experiments
- Keep it simple, reiterate the points of the vision (what should the system accomplish)

Maybe we could adopt some of the corporate styles of reflecting

- ! Reiterate the general values of the vision
- Open space in terms of who wants to participate
- You have a shared reflection at the end of a quarter or semester. (KPIs? key performance indicators)
- Here there should be humility by all parties involved.
- We try things in the form of experiments, see what works and what doesnt. Reflect together based on the resulting
  data.
- Part of reaching this process of unity is humility

unity of thought

- consultation -- best ideas can come out of the fusion instead of idea vs. idea
- explicit assumptions -- non negotiable facts (pitfall) -- tricky to identify
- Experiments (learning)

Martijn disagreement between value systems

- go meta
- go to the deeper principles
- pragmatic level is fine
- Unity
- Why would we strive for unity of thought? -- any system

Behrad

- Reflective on cultural fitte too much to capture

disciple

- path

fundamental fallacy forgetting, making the reduction explicit

reduction is not the problem its thinking that the reduction is real

Truths from this meeting

- Best ideas can come out of the fusion of ideas
- It is easy to forget your assumptions or in other words, it is easy to forget the lens through which you see
- As long as you have a shared vision, you can have unity of thought
- You need some form of periodic reflection, capture data in support of your experiments
- Humility is not optional, in johns words: you probably don't even know where you are headed in absolute terms yourself
  let alone/ a entire organization

  unity of purpose needs to be discoverd unity of thought needs to be build

  what kind of measurement is helpful for our learning process

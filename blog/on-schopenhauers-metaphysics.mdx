## On Schopenhauer's Metaphysics

In the same spirit of Bernardo Kastrup's book about Jung's metaphysics, he also wrote a book on Schopenhauer's
metaphysics.

> "The concepts form a peculiar class, existing only in the mind of man, and differing entirely from the representations
> of perception ... It would therefore be absurd to demand that the concepts should be demonstrated in experience, in so
> far as we understand by this the real external world that is simply representation of perception" - The World as Will
> and Representation

### Why we cannot see the real world

The title of Schopenhauer's magnum opus, The World as Will and Representation presents the dichotomy of the world as it
truly is and the representations there of. For Schopenhauer, the world as it is in itself is something that he describes
as the Will.

- the only way to circumvent representation is when something presents itself to you directly as an experience.
- even the process that engages that makes you notice that you are aware of this experience already requires a
  representation of the original experience as a means to encapsulate it.
- This makes sense because you have in no way the capacity to reproduce the experience in it's originality into a
  cognitive form as thought already requires the building blocks of representations in the form of language or images.

The definition of representation: "the description or portrayal of someone or something in a particular way"

### Perception proper

Schopenhauer claims that space and time can be perceived "directly" (without the senses).  
This was a new insight for me and is apparently also supported by Kant. The implication of this is that even without the
senses we still get a experiential sense of spacetime, claiming that we have internal access to it. This can be phrased
as "perception proper" and is a requirement in order to truly "home" the impressions made by our senses. In other words,
a required scaffolding to make sense of our perception. The first thought that comes to my mind when hearing this is in
some ways the nativist vs. constructionist argument of cognitive development, or in other words, is nature or nurture
responsible for development. The answer to that argument in the most general sense is a bit of both. Similarly, there is
something intrinsically "there" that provides the scaffolding to associate sense data with.

It is not inconceivable to me that even without the senses we are aware of the continuation of time. For example,
thoughts/images are presented in a chain and if time is defined as the process that represents the progression of
events, than one would notice that thought A precedes thought B. Secondly, even without the senses we have some internal
notion of the length of a thought that could serve as a, although inaccurate, basis for units of time.

## On Schopenhauer's Metaphysics

In the same spirit of Bernardo Kastrup's book about Jung's metaphysics, he also wrote a book 
on Schopenhauer's metaphysics.

> "The concepts form a peculiar class, existing only in the mind of man, and differing
entirely from the representations of perception ... It would therefore be absurd to demand that
the concepts should be demonstrated in experience, in so far as we understand by this the real 
external world that is simply representation of perception" - The World as Will and representation

### Perception proper

This was a new insight for me. Apparently a statement supported by Kant. 
Schopenhauer claims that space and time can be perceived "directly". With the implication that 
even without the senses we still get a experiential sense of spacetime, claiming that we have
internal access to it. This is required to truly "home" the impressions made by our senses.   
In other words, a required scaffolding to make sense of our perception. 
The first thought that comes to my mind when hearing this is in some ways the nativist vs. constructionist
argument of cognitive development. It is not inconceivable to me that even without the senses 
we are aware of the continuation of time. For example, thoughts/images are presented in a chain and if
time is defined as the process that represents the progression of events, than one would notice that
thought A precedes thought B. Secondly, even without the senses we have some internal notion of 
the length of a thought that could serve as a, although inaccurate, basis for units of time.

## Brain Limitations

There used to be a time when we tried to find the cause of suicide by performing a post-mortem
examination of the brain and try to find the source of this action.
Of course, this examination would never be able to reveal a true causal source. 
I would argue that this is not due to a limitation of the available technology utilized in examination,
but rather a misunderstanding of what is actually being investigated.

The brain is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for explaining something as complex as suicide.
Our modern day technology enabled us to see that the brain is the most complex material structure
in the known universe. But, even this statement is doing it short. What we recognize as the 'brain'
is but an artificial constructed boundary around a 'thing' that we identify as a single object. 
It is easy to forget that this in itself is but a model or a image that exists for our own convenience. 
We have known since ancient times that everything in the body is connected. This is of course quite 
obvious because generally, at least for a reasonable amount of time, we don't seem to fall apart. 
But besides the things that are keeping our limps and organs together, there also appears to be
more complex interactions between various parts of the body. For example, the interaction between the 
heart and the brain can result in different levels of attention and arousal. To make it even more 
complex, our gut engages in a symbiotic relationship with bacteria. This means that bacteria indirectly
influence processes in the brain through the vagal nerve. 

When inspecting only one organ in isolation it becomes obvious that the true complexity of the organism
cannot be inferred by looking at one part individually. Like the mantra of Gestalt theory, the whole 
is greater than the sum of the parts.


- One step further, cannot even be derived from a material dead body.
- True complexity resides in the patterns of activation 
- Once 'booted' it continually expresses the continuation of activation and interaction with itself and others.
- You would need an active network-like interactionist model to capture the momentary complexity which 
most accurately would end up like an emulation of the original. Then still I would argue that you could 
only simulate a potential future but not the original one. The original spirit/willing that constitutes the pattern
is gone.

- Unspeakably more depends on what things are called than on what they are. - Nietzsche

## Structured Inquiry

- 


Hey Parsa! Yes that's right, Ill try to recapture my thoughts. 
I thought about/hinted at the general problem on how to structure/associate information. 
We each try to automatically categorize things but on a group you need to somehow coordinate that process to keep track of the direction of inquiry.
I think the one/two questions per session are very fitting as they allow for a general starting point and then have the free associations during a discussion.

When we were close to the end I knew a lot of interesting things were said but my notes were quite messy. 
I was thinking on how to consolidate all this to keep track of the direction we are taking.
(This is getting meta now because this is going into the direction of the process of both learning and synonymously, 'striving for clarity' haha)

A answer could be to keep track of a hierarchical map of questions that can extend both vertically and horizontally.
Vertical would be going deeper on the parent question, while horizontal would be something of a different angle.
In case of our previous questions:

1. What should be the goal that the educational systems follow? 
2. How to develop a continuos integrative process within the eduction of a single individual?

Question 1 is in our case more general so higher up the hierarchy than 2 because 2 already has the assumption that integration is something that is part of a relevant goal for educational systems.
I don't know, even just the attempt in building this hierarchy in of itself might be useful as it could open up new thoughts.
And, as we traverse the hierarchy by going deeper, it might at some point (hopefully) resolve some questions higher up so it would also be nice to also store the answers given on a question.

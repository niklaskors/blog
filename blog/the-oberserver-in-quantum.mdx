## The Observer In Quantum

I believe it to be quite normal that the process of understanding Quantum Mechanics (QM) 
produces a continual wave (pun intended) of understanding and confusion. 
It's two most controversial aspects to me are that of the implications of the observer 
and the non-contextual forms of entanglement. I have to admit that my only source of
knowledge about QM is so far only derived from references from books about other topics
and from explanations from YouTube that spontaneously appeared in my feed. 

I think that I found the reason for my confusion as I have been receiving explanations from 
two different camps. The two camps in my case being:

- The Copenhagen interpretation 
- The Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation

Let's look at the double-slit experiment through the lens of both interpretations

### The Double-Slit Experiment 
You shoot individual particles (e.g., photons or electrons) at a barrier with two slits,
and behind that, there's a screen to detect where they land. If no detectors are placed at 
the slits, and you fire many particles one at a time, they form an interference pattern—as 
if each particle behaves like a wave going through both slits at once.
But if you place detectors at the slits to see which slit each particle went through, 
the interference pattern disappears, and particles land like individual particles.
This suggests something about "knowing" the path causes the wave-like behavior to vanish.

#### The Copenhagen interpretation 

*What happens?*
When there are no detectors, the particle exists in a superposition of going through 
both slits—like a wave. When you place a detector at the slits, the which-path information 
is recorded in the universe. This physical record, even if not observed by a human, is 
enough to collapse the wave function, and the particle behaves like a classical object.
The disappearance of the interference pattern is due to the loss of coherence (i.e. decoherence) 
when the environment interacts with the particle.

*Role of Observer?*
No consciousness required.
A physical interaction that leaves a record is a measurement.
The universe "knows" the path because it’s recorded—that alone collapses the wave.

#### The Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation

*What happens?*
When no conscious observer checks the result, the electron is in a superposition—a 
cloud of overlapping possibilities. If a conscious mind observes which slit the particle 
went through, then the wave function collapses, and the particle behaves classically.
Placing a detector at the slit does not count as a measurement unless the output is consciously observed.
Until a mind checks the data, the system remains in entangled superposition
(electron + detector + environment all together).

*Role of Observer?*
Consciousness is essential.
A detector alone does not cause collapse—only conscious observation does.
The world becomes "real" only when it is experienced.

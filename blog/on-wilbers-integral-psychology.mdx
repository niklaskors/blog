## On Wilber's Integral Psychology

Recently I decided to pick up one of Ken Wilber's books. 
His book called *Integral Psychology: Consciousness, Spirit, Psychology, Therapy* 
had been floating around on my e-reader for a long time, and after reading Bernardo Kastrup's
book about Jung's Metaphysics, I for some reason thought it was the right time for this book.

I am not entirely sure what my motivation was for transferring it to my e-reader in the first place.
I knew very little about Ken Wilber and his work. I have heard about his four quadrant model once
and I have seen [this controversial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFFMtq5g8N4) years ago 
that potentially revealed his ability to actively manipulate brain measurement equipment. 
After doing some more research on his background while reading his book, I found that he used to be 
quite popular in the 80's & 90's. Today he is talked about a lot less although he is still actively
writing new books. His last book *Finding Radical Wholeness* just came out in 2024. I am not 
equipped enough to distill his many works into a single underlying mission so please take this 
with a grain of salt; but it does appear to me that he wants to point out that there are multiple 
sides that can refer the same underlying truth. He does this in part by his attempts to
integrate many different fields of study. The field that is also included and controversial in the realm of
science are the eastern spiritual traditions. For this reason he is most likely often seen
as this *spiritual guru* type. Despite the controversy I am trying to follow Wilber's message here 
by stating that there might be some interesting sides to this field as well.

### No coincidence

Now, the reason why I picked up this particular book at this time, might not have been a coincidence.
I have been going down the rabbit hole of metaphysical idealism by reading Kastrup's books, as well as 
Jung's more metaphysically-laden book *Answer to Job*. I did not think Wilber's book would be related
to this topic in any way, shape or form, but interestingly enough, when I started reading the 
introductory *Note to the Reader*, I started questioning how I could have somehow been responsible 
for reading a text that was so in-line with my previous readings about metaphysics. It describes the history of the field of
psychology and the monumental influence of Gustav Fechner. It was Fechner who figured out a way to conduct quantitative measurements 
on the mind as formulated in what is now known as [Fechner's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law).
This law is one of the building blocks that moved psychology from the hands of philosophy into the
more quantitative science it is today. But apparently, apart from his contributions to psychology he also
made some metaphysical claims in one of is books called *Life after Death*. In this book he lays out the notion
that the universe if fundamentally 'psychic', and in his particular form it is considered to fall into the category
of neutral monism. One of his main points is that mind and matter are inseparable forms of the underlying reality.
His attempts to describe the mind in quantitative terms was meant to highlight this inseparability and the reality in both.
Not reducing the mind to a sheer epiphenomenon by the material brain. This quote from a scholar of Fechner's could not make
it more explicit: *"The whole universe is spiritual in character, the phenomenal world of physics being
merely the external manifestation of this spiritual reality."*

This to me was stroke me as uncannily similar to my previous readings. I could not help but wonder if this is either 
a form of me unconsciously selecting this book based on prior signs of a probable continuation of the same theme, or if this was some
instance of Jung's synchronicity. Despite my personal relation to it, I also see some similarities between some of the
messages that both Kastrup and Wilber try to send. They seem in some aspects to be similar voices at different times. 
They both try to show the importance of 'the other side of the coin', namely, the importance and non-reducibility
of the individual's inner mental experience. One of the ways in which Kastrup points this out is by stating that qualia 
cannot be reduced to quantitative measures. Likewise, Wilber makes the point that we ended up in what he calls the 'flatland' of modernity
by reducing everything to matter, losing the side that used to previously 'enchant' the world (Max Weber: "the disenchantment of the world").

### The Four Quadrant Model

Throughout the book Wilber uses a lot of the language that is associated with his models and systems.
I am usually not a fan of models within psychology as it is often the case that creating models can sometimes feel like
ends in themselves as opposed to actually being helpful. But of course, models do serve important purposes, one of them is
to make something that is too complicated to grasp directly into a representation that is easier to work with.
The model that was most helpful while reading the book was introduction of the four quadrant model that I believe is presented
throughout his books. I will try to give a concise summary of what this model represents.   
First, the different quadrants:

- Upper-Left: The I (internal, individual), The Beautiful, first person
- Upper-Right: The IT (external, individual), The True, third person
- Lower-Left: The WE (internal, collective), The Good, second person
- Lower-Right: The ITS (external, collective), The True, third person 

As can be seen, there are two rough distinguishable categories: internal/external, individual/collective.
It acknowledges one of the most fundamental distinctions. There can be a thing that you can point to (IT/ITS) and there is a
thing that points (I/WE). In case of psychology and neuropsychology, there is the subjective experience of the senses (I) 
and the objective measurements in the brain that correlate with them (IT). In case of anthropology and sociology, there are the 
cultural and moral values that exist within a community (WE) and the social structures like institutions that correlate this values (ITS).
While this might appear obvious, it is also easy to forget the existence of the others when you are working or thinking
for a long time in any of the individual quadrants. Or likewise it can also be easy to miss, that findings in one quadrant are
likely to emerge in a similar correlated form on the other side. Or it can be easy to make bold claims regarding causality, 
that one of the quadrants is the cause of the other, while instead, it is probably only the correlations that can be pointed out.
These points are being highlighted throughout the book 


### Modernism and postmodernism

Modernism = the reduction to IT and ITS, also known as the flatland, goes too far in extreme reductionism
Post-Modernism = the attempt to salvage the I and WE, everyone has there unique interpretation and value within. 
Takes it too far because it flattens all hierarchy and actual values

### Two world mythology

- Not trying to move away from this world by refering to the beyond as a distinct place but rather
trying to find that world right here and now (Vervaeke, Wilber)


### Open Questions

- The definition of spiritualism is defined in 5 different ways in the book but generally it is assumed that it constitutes
a higher level of consciousness. The idea that there is an ongoing evolution on the cultural/societal level towards this 
continuous development of the population's consciousness towards this potentially higher domain seems like an interesting idea.
For this to be true several assumptions need to be validated: 
  - Is spiritualism truly a higher form of consciousness?
  - If so, does the trajectory of the individual necessarily translate to the trajectory of society as a whole?
